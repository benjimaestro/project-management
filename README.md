# HOW TO CONNECT TO THE DATABASE
Don't use your own database! We share a database. Here is now to connect to it.
In Visual Studio, open the Server Explorer panel
Then, right click SQL Databases (Under Azure) and click Open SQL Object Explorer
The side panel should be the SQL Object Explorer.
Then in the top row of the side panel, click the green + (Add SQL server)
Set Authentication to SQL Server Authentication
Set Server Name to tabarserver.database.windows.net
Set User Name to TabarAdmin
Set Password to Tabar123!
Leave Database Name as <default>
Press connect, it should work

Then, download this and run it: http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mjdean/notes/modules/Shared%20Content/DataConnection/AzureConnect.exe
Server should be tabarserver
Database should be TabarDB
Username should be TabarAdmin
Password should be Tabar123!

Once the form is filled you should leave it running while you are working. You should then be able to connect to the database.
